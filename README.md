# all-in-one-qol-chrome-extension

- Fixes audio file playing issues in old websites
- auto-close Zoom post-attendee page
  - auto-close Zoom #success page after 5 minutes
- auto-load fine typographic adjustments to news articles

This is my personal chrome extension, feel free to use it if its features align with your usage.

Eventually, I plan to separate out the features into their own respective extensions.
