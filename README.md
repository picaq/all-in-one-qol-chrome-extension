# all-in-one-qol-chrome-extension

Fix audio file playing issues in old websites, auto-close Zoom post-attendee page, auto-load fine typographic adjustments

This is my personal chrome extension, feel free to use if its features align with your usage.

Eventually, I plan to separate out the features into their own respective extensions.
